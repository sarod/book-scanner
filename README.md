# Book Scanner

A React-based web application for scanning books and match them against a book list.
Upload a list of books from CSV or text files, scan ISBN codes using your camera, and automatically match scanned books to your imported list.

SPA deployed at https://sarod.github.io/book-scanner/

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: Scanner works a lot better on android where it relies on Web standard https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API

## Usage

1. Upload your book list using the file upload button (supports CSV and text files)
2. Click "Start scanning" to begin scanning ISBN codes with your camera
3. Scanned books will automatically fetch metadata and match against your list
4. View results showing matched books (‚úÖ), unmatched books (üîé), and extraneous scans (‚ö†Ô∏è)
